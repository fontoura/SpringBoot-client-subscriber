# Sample Kafka publisher-subscriber project

This is a sample Kafka application implementing a REST API which publishes events to a Kafka topic, and a worker which consumes messages from this topic and prints them on the console. This application is not meant for practical use - it is meant to be used merely as a working example of all these things put together.
